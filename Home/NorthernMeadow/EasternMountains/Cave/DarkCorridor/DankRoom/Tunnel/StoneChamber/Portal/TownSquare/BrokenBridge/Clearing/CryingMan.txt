"You! You're a magic-user! I can tell, you've got that look. Come to finish the job, have you? Well, go ahead, do your worst there's nothing else you can 
take from me. Not since the rest of you were here a few days ago."  
 
"What happened? You DARE to ask-- you know perfectly well what happened. Your friends, the wizard's minions, destroyed my house and kidnapped my poor 
daughter, that's what! My wife even went into town to look for help, and I haven't heard from her since!"  
 
"Hm? Well, I guess it's true that you don't look like one of the wizard's minions. Still, I don't trust you magicfolk. If you really are who you say you are, 
then prove your good intentions by making me a new House!"
