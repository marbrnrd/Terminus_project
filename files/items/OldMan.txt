You speak with the old man. He greets you warmly as if you were old friends. You feel at ease with him. 
"Hello adventurer! Top of the morning to you! You seem like a young and energetic explorer. If you're brave enough, your destiny awaits within this cave. 
That destiny will manifest itself as a portal. Enter this portal and begin the next chapter of your life." 
The old man sees the shock on your face and smiles a comforting smile, "I am but a fragile old man, and cannot accompany you through this cave, but what I 
can provide are a few simple spells that will help you along your way. Just read my old manuscripts and tryout those spells."
